    <li>Printers - will print generated pdf-s.</li>
    <li>Local (internal) network - for proper communication between computers, printers, and different medical clinics if they will be using our system</li>
</ul>
<h2>Unfunctional requirements:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>System must be adapted to the provisions of Polish law</li>
    <li>System must be fully configured and thusready to implementall the required functionalities.</li>
    <li>System must meet the security requirements for user access to system resources through the use of user authentication mechanisms</li>
    <li>System must provide resources protection against unauthorized access from outside and inside the system</li>
    <li>System should be scalable</li>
    <li>System must provide mechanisms for granting access rights, enabling selected users to selectively access information</li>
